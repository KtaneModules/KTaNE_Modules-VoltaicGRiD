# Customs (Needy)

A boss-esque needy module with a focus on preparedness. Relay the info before the timer starts, or else you might have some issues!

## How To Solve
At the start of the game, identify & relay the country, items, and document. This information **will not** change when the needy is activated, but will change every time the needy is **deactivated**. This allows you to relay the info after solving, and prepare to answer correctly when the very short, 20 second timer initiates.

> [!CAUTION]
> There are some items in the list that might try to trick you about what category they fall into.

> [!NOTE]
> There __will__ be items that appear on the module, that don't appear in the list, the manual discusses how to deal with this.
